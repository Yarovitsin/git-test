The findBiggest function from main.cpp works as follows:

The function is passed a pointer to an array of integers and the size of the array.
The function loops through the array and compares the current element to the biggest element found so far.
If the current element is bigger than the biggest element found so far, then the current element is stored as the biggest element found so far.
After the loop has finished, the biggest element found so far is returned.
