# findSmallest
The function is passed a pointer to an array of integers and the size of the array.
The function loops through the array and compares the current element to the smallest element found so far.
If the current element is smaller than the smallest element found so far, then the current element is stored as the smallest element found so far.
After the loop has finished, the smallest element found so far is returned.
